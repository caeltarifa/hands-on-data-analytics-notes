## Step 3- Add a Filter Action

1.  With  **Donut chart**  selected, open  **Actions**  panel from  **left rail**.
2.  Click the  **Filter same-sheet visuals**  button. This is a shortcut to create a Filter Action which will filter all other visuals on the dashboard using all the dimensions used in this visual.
3.  Select a  **slice**  in the  **Donut chart**  and see how all other charts on the dashboard filter just to that Industry.  
    To deselect you can click the same slice again, or click in the empty space just inside or outside of the donut.
4.  Note the drill down we built before is now accessible via a right-click rather than a left-click.

    or one of your choice.

    The  **Dates / Send On**  section let's you set a schedule frequency.
4.  In the  **Email**  section, select the  **File attachment**  option.
5.  Click  **SEND TEST**  button. This will trigger a one time test report mail out.  
    - Note - *It is okay if you clicked the Save button. You can delete it by clicking the ellipsis against it and then the Delete option.  
    If you are using a temp account provided by AWS, ensure that you don't leave a saved schedule in here to avoid getting scheduled emails while the account is in queue for recycling.*
