### Battery for answering raised questions and requested queries.

1) Which option would it be the most suitable for SaaC if we regard Terraform or AWS CloudFormation?

3) Is it possible to trigger a Redshift's ETL job in order to automatically upload pretty large amount of data by, for example, Lambda or are there any other options?
4) What is Quicksight's limit for downloading data after being processed?
5) How to choose either Athena, Glue, or Redshift for making queries and how to find out the right skillfulness? 
6) Redshift's snapshots, where are stored? how can I get them automatically?
7) How to perform a developing, testing, and production environment for data analysis separately? is there any fit or standard solution?
